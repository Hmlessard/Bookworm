## Introduction
---------------
Bookworm is a web application that allows users to take part in book reviews and discussions through the use of forms. 
Users can created new posts (or reviews) of a book and also read and comment on other user’s reviews. 
Each user has a dashboard that shows all their reviews they have posted as well as the ability to keep a list of books they would like to read.



## User Story
-------------

As a user who loves books and discussions with fellow book-lovers, I want a CMS-style blog site where I can post reviews of books I’ve read and also take part in discussions with other users by allowing comments on posts.
